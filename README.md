# UnishoxSharp

C# port of Unishox, work in progress.

Currently, only Unishox 1 is available, and its API style is close to that of the original C library.

Original Unishox: https://github.com/siara-cc/Unishox2

> In general compression utilities such as `zip`, `gzip` do not compress short strings well and often expand them. They also use lots of memory which makes them unusable in constrained environments like Arduino. So Unishox algorithm was developed for individually compressing (and decompressing) short strings.
>
> Note: Unishox provides the best compression for short text and not to be compared with general purpose compression algorithm like lz4, snappy, lzma, brottli and zstd.
